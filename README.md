Curriculum for educating young engineers in a secondary school weekly
after-school program.

For a complete formatted compilation of all the information here, check
out the file `Book.pdf`.

The documentation here is written in [asciidoc](http://asciidoc.org/) format.
You can build the pdf document via docbook:
```bash
asciidoc -b docbook Book.txt
dblatex Book.xml
```

The `demos/` directory present non-interactive lessons that may be
useful to run before launching into a challenge.

The `workshops/` directory contain the challenges that may be used to
fill an academic year for a club that meets weekly.

The `supplemental/` directory contains additional challenges that you may
want to use to fill time or plug in outside of the regular workshop
curriculum.
