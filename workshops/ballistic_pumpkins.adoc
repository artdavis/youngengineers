=== Ballistic Pumpkins
.Disciplines:
* Mechanical Engineering

.Setup:
Depending on available materials, you can either have teams build multiple
trebs or build one trebuchet (let the whole class assemble it as 1 team) and
then let them break out and compete on getting the best distance with their own
customized sling designs.

Miniature pumpkin gourds or alternatively golf balls may be used for
launching. You could get orange golf balls and or decorate them like
jack-o-lanterns to keep with the pumpkin theme.

.Preparation:
* Build PVC pipe trebuchet

Some experimentation will be necessary to build the throwing arm and might
be incorporated into a workshop. I made a throwing arm out of plywood with
good success.

.Teaming:
Teams of 2-3 making sure youngest are teamed with older student(s)

.Challenge:
"Launch a mini-pumpkin as far as possible"

WARNING: Be sure to use a rope to pull the trigger pin while everyone stands clear of the trebuchet.

For consistency, and if you don't have mini-pumpkins, tennis balls may be used instead.
See what modifications can be made to get the projectiles the farthest.
Try launching different kinds of balls like golf balls and bouncy balls.
See what happens when the sling is filled with several smaller bouncy balls.

WARNING: Make sure to take necessary precautions to avoid having a projectile
hit someone. Particularly with hard projectiles like golf balls.

.Further Challenges:
"Launch a mini-pumpkin into a target bucket"

Adjusting the pin on the sling arm can control the release angle.
Changing the sling length will have an effect on distance.
Safely increasing the conterweight will make the balls launch farther.
Mounting wheels on the frame will make it launch farther.
