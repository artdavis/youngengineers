=== LEGO Engineering Challenge
.Disciplines:
* Mechanical Engineering

.Setup:
By selecting one building challenge activity for all of the teams to work
on there is more opportunity for collaboration. If a team completes their
project try to direct them on to additional challenges on the same
project. They may also help out other teams or work on sorting the main LEGO
collection.

.Resources:
The Educating Young Engineers website provides very good ideas for LEGO
design challenges:

** This is a great video to show the celebration of failure. Point out
   how many weeks of hard work it was building the ball and then what was
   everyone's reaction when it crumbled. Absolute joy!
** Also see what else the class notices from the experiment. Another
   thing to call attention to was the safety precautions. Yes the experiment
   failed, but by making sure everyone is safe, nobody was in danger of
   getting hurt.

.Preparation

.Challenges:
* Drop Test
** http://www.educatingyoungengineers.com/drop-test
** Teaming: Individual
** Combine exactly 20 LEGO bricks so that when dropped they do not break
*** If gathering 20 identical bricks for each student is too tall of an order,
    impose a minimum weight requirement (around the weight of 20 2x6 bricks).
*** Alternatively leave the requirements open and allow the students to record
    the number of bricks, drop height and weight of their creation. Evaluate
    correlations.
** Use a meter stick to drop from progressively higher distances and record the max drop height before their structure breaks apart.
** Have the students iterate to try to improve their height
** Have a review discussion on successful strategies

* Collaborative Monsters
** http://www.educatingyoungengineers.com/musical-monsters
** Teaming: Individual
** Everyone starts bulding a monster. Use music or a stopwatch to indicate when
   to stop building and pass their creation off to their neighbor. Continue for
   several rounds and then review everyones creations.
** Ask if any of the monsters turned out how they thought they would when they
   started building them.

* Engineering Escapes
** http://www.educatingyoungengineers.com/engineering-escapes
** Teaming: 3-5
** Put a LEGO minifigure in a bin and have the team build a solution to
   get him out.
** With each iteration, impose new challenges
*** No stairs
*** No elevators

* Tallest Tower
** http://www.educatingyoungengineers.com/tallest-tower
** Teaming: 3-5
** See who can build the tallest tower.
** Have teams request measurement checkpoints with a tape measure.
** Discuss successful and unsuccessful strategies.

* Boat Building
** http://www.educatingyoungengineers.com/boat-building
** Reproduce the link:workshops/unsinkable_boat.adoc[Uninskable Boat] workshop
   except with LEGOS.
