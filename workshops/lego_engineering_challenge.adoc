=== LEGO Engineering Challenge
.Disciplines:
* Mechanical Engineering

.Setup:
By selecting one building challenge activity for all of the teams to work
on there is more opportunity for collaboration. If a team completes their
project try to direct them on to additional challenges on the same
project. They may also help out other teams or work on sorting the main LEGO
collection.

.Resources:
The Educating Young Engineers website provides very good ideas for LEGO
design challenges:

** This is a great video to show the celebration of failure. Point out
   how many weeks of hard work it was building the ball and then what was
   everyone's reaction when it crumbled. Absolute joy!
** Also see what else the class notices from the experiment. Another
   thing to call attention to was the safety precautions. Yes the experiment
   failed, but by making sure everyone is safe, nobody was in danger of
   getting hurt.
