=== Battling Bristle Bots
.Disciplines:
* Robotic Engineering
* Electrical Engineering

.Materials:
Per Student
* Toothbrushes
* Pager Motors
* 3D Printed Parts
* CR2032 Batteries

.Preparation:
3D print enough bristle bot bodies for the class.

.Topic Introduction:
Demonstrate the design process
* Inspiration research
* Preliminary prototyping
* Incremental iteration
* 3D Printing
* Circuit/motor demonstration for instance using snap circuits

Demonstrate how a closed curcuit with an electric motor causes the
motor to turn.

Walk through the prototype process:
* Hot glue motor and battery onto toothbrush
  - Kept falling over. Ideas to fix?
    - Needs to be balanced
* Iterations on 3D Printed parts
  - First getting toothbrush to fit
  - Ridges to capture toothbrush
  - Features to hold motor and battery
  - Feature for routing wires
  - Features to hold custom add-ons
* Solicit any theories on how the bristlebot locomotion works
  - Demonstrate what happens if bristles are bent one way or the other.

.Challenge:
Construct and customize a Bristle Bot then pit them against the bots built
by your classmates.
