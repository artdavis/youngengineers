==== Introduction

* Name tags for all. Every meeting.

* For all of our meetings, everyone must wear footwear that fully covers
  your feet.

* We will be building and launching rockets.
  Rockets will get lost. Prepare for that.
  It will make you sad but always try to learn from the failure.
  Failure is part of the process and should be celebrated.


==== Safety and Discipline

* Everyone must at all times control their actions and follow the instructions
  of the adults. I know this is especially difficult after a long day in
  school and the excitement of being outside and launching rockets. But
  PLEASE control your actions. We'll be here to help, but if you cannot do
  it, you will not build and launch a rocket. I'm sorry, it just is not safe.
  Being safe is our most important task.
** If you are chasing someone... STOP immediately
** If you are being chased do not run away. Calmly ask the chaser to stop and
   walk over to an adult for help.
** If you are not being safe, you will have to do an alternative activity like
   coloring sheets or Legos.


==== Newton's Laws of Motion

. Inertia: An object at rest stays at rest. An object in motion stays in motion.
* After a rocket engine burns out, the rocket continues to go up.
   The ejection charge is on a delay.
** Ask what happens to the rockets direction when the engine burns out
** Demonstrate throwing a ball upwards.
*** All the upward force on the ball stops as soon as I release the ball.
    Yet it continues upward.
*** Ask about the ball's velocity or speed (decreases on way up, zero at
    apogee and increases on way down).
*** Ask about velocity of the ball at the moment it's released and the moment
    I catch it (If caught at the same point it was released, the downward
    velocity when caught equals the upward velocity when thrown).
*** What is acceleration? (how fast the velocity changes)
*** What is the acceleration of the ball? (a constant 9.8m/s/s downward once
     released).

. latexmath:[F=m\times a]
* Does everyone know how to multiply?
** If the mass of something increases, what happens to the force of gravity
   on it? (it increases... it weighs more) Draw up arrows on the `F` and `m`.
** `a` is the acceleration of the object as it falls. `F` increases the
   same amount as `m` increases. `a` stays the same; heavy and lightweight
   objects fall with the same acceleration.
* A force changes velocity.
  The change depends on mass.
  A change in velocity generates a force.
* The force of gravity is always pulling down.
  Slow an upward travelling rocket to a stop and rocket begins to go downward.
  When does free fall start? (when engine burns out, even though still going up)
* For increasing mass, the acceleration due to gravity stays the same so the
  force of gravity is increased.
  Or another way, since if mass is increased, more force is required to create
  the same amount of acceleration since acceleration due to gravity is constant.
* If the force of gravity were to hypothetically stay fixed with increasing mass,
  then the acceleration would have to decrease for heavier objects and heavier
  objects would fall slower than lighter objects.
* The acceleration due to gravity is the same no matter the weight.
  Demonstrate dropping two balls that are the same size but different weight
  (golf ball vs. hollow plastic golf ball) from high up.

. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
* Exhaust from burning fuel shoots out the back of a rocket engine causing
  forward thrust.
* Hold up spent and unspent rocket engines as a demonstration.

==== Air Resistance

.Inquire
Where have you felt air resistance?

* Wind, fans, open car window

.Inquire
How can you increase air resistance?

* Increase surface area
* Increase speed (of the wind or of the object? does it matter?)

.Demonstration
* Take two sheets of paper. Ask if they weigh the same.
* Crumple one up. Ask if the two sheets of paper still weigh the same.
* Have the class predict what will happen when both sheets of paper are
  dropped from a height simultaneously.
* Why did the balled up sheet of paper hit the ground first?
* More surface area means greater air resistance.
* The force of air pressure for a falling object works against the force of
gravity.
* What is the force of air resistance for a stationary object?
* What happens to the air pressure as the object moves faster and faster?
* For heavier objects, more air pressure is required to counteract the
  force of gravity since heavier objects experience increased force from
  gravity.
** From the golf ball example, since the real golf ball and the lightweight
   plastic one are the same size, they will have the same air resistance. But
   since the force of gravity on the real golf ball is more, it will have more
   acceleration because the counteracting force of the air pressure is less
   significant compared to the force of gravity.

==== Cutting Knife Safety

Let the class know that the activities are about to start.
The first activity will require the use of a hobby knife.
All cutting will be done under the direct supervision of an adult.
Methodically explain each of the rules for hobby knife safety:

* Do not goof around with the knife at all, in any way, ever.
  Anyone who does so even once will have the knife taken away immediately
  and will not get a second chance to use a knife today.
** NEVER even pretend to use a blade improperly
** NEVER point a blade at another person
** Instruct the workshop helpers to have zero tolerance on this rule.
   Any observed violation results in immediate hobby knife confiscation
   for the rest of the workshop.
* Always wear safety glasses when using a hobby knife.
* The knife may only be used under the direct supervision of an adult.
* Only an adult may take the plastic cap off the top of the knife.
** Instruct the adult assistants that when they are ready, uncap the knife
   and place it back down on the table.
* Make sure that when you place the knife down that it is not in a position
  where it can roll off the table. If it does so, it may very easily stick
  into your foot. Everyone must have footwear that fully covers their feet.
* Only cut on an acceptable cutting surface. Cutting boards will be provided.
* Prepare and think before each cut. Consider what will happen to the blade
  if it was to slip and make sure there's nothing in the way to harm.
* Never hold the workpiece you are cutting in your hand. It should always
  lay on the cutting surface.
* When cutting, give your undivided attention to the workpiece the whole time.
* Hold the blade like a pencil.
* Slowly and steadily draw the blade toward yourself while cutting.
  Only very light downward pressure should be necessary.
* Keep the blade straight on with the cut. Never twist the blade.
* When done cutting, place the knife down on the table. Adult assistants
  should then recap the knife.

==== Making a parachute

.Principle:
Air Resistance

* Parachute components: Canopy, suspension lines, harness, payload
* Student groups make their own parachute using the
  `Plastic-Bag-Parachute-Instructions` worksheet.
* Adult helpers must closely supervise hobby knife usage.
* Additional challenges:
** Race the parachutes to the ground. Last one down is the winner.
** Predict and experiment with increasing the weight of the payload with
   extra clothespins or other improvised weights.
** Predict and experiment with multiple canopies per clothespin.
** Test what happens when cutting a hole in the canopy.
** Experiment with different number of suspension lines and canopy shape.
** Let the students come up with ideas to experiment with.
** Would a hammer and feather fall at the same rate in a vacuum?
*** Search the internet for "feather and hammer drop on moon"

==== Rocket Balloon

.Principle:
Newton's Laws of Motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

* Student groups make balloon rockets following the
  `Rocket-Balloon-Instructions` worksheet.
* Race balloon vehicles along string/fishing line tracks.
* Try different inclination angles of the string. Does the balloon fly
  different distances at different inclination angles? What force is acting
  against it at higher inclination angles? (gravity)
* What if we tape a payload to the rocket? Why doesn't it go as far or fast?
  (increased weight means increased force due to gravity which counteracts
  the force of the thrust)
* What would happen with parachute taped to the balloon?
** What about cutting a hole in the middle of the parachute?
