=== 3D Printing
.Disciplines:
* Chemical Engineering
* Mechanical Engineering

.Resources:

.Materials:
* Hot glue gun and glue sticks for each student/team
* 608 ball bearings (22mm diam ball bearings)
** Quality and price varies widely and better bearings will make better spinners
* M8-1.25 Hex Nuts or similar

.Preparation
* Print and cut out the fidget spinner templates. The central circle and
  hexagonal shapes on the 3 arms should also be trimmed out using a blade.
  If you have sufficient time and supervision, students may do the cutting.

.Warmup:
Have some example 3D Printed parts available for the students to play with.
What discernible features can they notice and describe?

.Topic Introduction:

* Who knows what 3D Printing is?

* What are the different kinds of 3D Printing?
** SLA/DLP - Stereolithograph and Dligital Light Processing
*** Light is used to cure/harden layer by layer
** FDM - Fused deposition modeling
*** Most common consumer printers
*** Plastic filament pressed into a hot nozzle and melted. Plastic is
    deposited layer by layer to build up the part.
* SLS/SLM - Selective Laser Sintering/Melting
** High power laser scans over metallic powder and either fuses (sintering)
   or melts the particles layer by layer to form the part.

* Notice how the technology typically works by building a part up, layer
  by layer. Imagine (or demonstrate) cutting an apple up into slices.  Build
  the apple back up by stacking the layers on top of each other.

* Draw some sample shapes and how they will slice up
** Cube - Easy to print. What does each layer cross section look like?
   (squares)
** Cone - Easy to print. Layers? (Progressively smaller circles)
** Sphere - Difficult to print. Layers (Small to large to small circles).
*** Difficult to print large circles on top of small circles.
*** Any way to make easier? (Print two hemispheres and put them together)
** Standing candy cane - Can't print without "support". Nothing for the end of
   the cane to hold it up
*** Can think of a way to print the candy cane? (print it on its side)
** Can the class think of some other object shape limitations?

* Draw a block diagram to illustrate the process of 3D Printing
** DESIGN (or download) 3D Model. What kind of software do you think is used?
   (CAD - Computer Aided Design)
** SLICE the CAD model. Turn the 3D model into flat layers so that the 3D
   printer can build it up.
** PRINT. The sliced model is sent to the printer 1 layer at a time.

* The most common consumer 3D printers are FDM printers
  (Fused Deposition Modeling).
** Plastic filament is pressed into a hot nozzle and melted. Plastic is
    deposited layer by layer to build up the part.
** What every day crafty thing can you think of that works like the hot nozzle
   of an FDM printer? (glue guns)
** How do you imagine you could make a flat solid layer with a glue gun?
   (outline the perimeter and then go back and fill-in the inside).

WARNING: Review Glue Gun Safety

Ref: https://www.gluegunsdirect.com/service-and-advice/glue-gun-safety-advice/

* Do not horseplay. Unsafe users will not be able to use glue guns and will
  have them taken away.
* Do not get your face close to the glue gun or hot glue.
  * If the fumes bother you, get some fresh air
  * If you get it in your eyes, rinse with cold water and have an adult seek
    medical attention for you.
  * If you ingest hot glue, do not throw up. Drink lots of water and have an
    adult seek medical attention for you.
* Do not touch the molten glue. If you get it on your skin, immediately run
  cold water over it. Ask an adult to help with removal (using olive oil or
  liquid paraffin cotton pad).
* Wear safety glasses
* Don't touch or touch anything else with the hot nozzle tip.
* Give the glueing work your full attention at all times.
* Place the glue gun down safely so the hot tip is not in contact with anything
* Always unplug the glue gun when your are done
* Make sure to work on a surface that hot glue can drip on safely.

.Activity

Manually 3D Print a fidget spinner using a glue gun

* Decorate a fidget spinner paper template as you like.
* Cut out the paper template including central circular hole and 3 hexagons
  on the arms if not already trimmed.
* Place a ball bearing on the center hole and 3 hexnuts over the hexagonal
  shapes on the arms.
* Use a glue gun to trace the perimeters of the bearing and nuts which should
  affix them to the paper template.
* Apply a bead of glue around the outside perimeter of the template.
* Apply the "infill" by systematically filling in the spaces between the
  perimeter glue beads.

NOTE: Make sure to to apply an equal amount of glue to each arm of the template
so that the spinner will be in balance. A poorly balanced spinner will not
spin well.

* Repeat this process again 1 layer at a time until the glue thickness equals
  the thickness of the bearing and the hex nuts.
* Allow several minutes for the glue to cool
* Pluck off any extra strands of glue
* Spin your spinner!

Two 4in. length glue sticks should be enough to make 1 spinner.

The central bearing may be popped out and replaced and/or used for making
a new spinner.
