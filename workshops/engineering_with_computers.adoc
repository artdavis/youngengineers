=== Engineering with Computers
.Disciplines:
* Interdisciplinary

.Materials:
* 1 laptop per 1-2 students
* Ubermix Linux operating system
** http://www.ubermix.org/

.Location:
Large room with computers available at each table

.Preparation:
Install `ubermix` on all of the computers. Alternatively acquire enough
USB keys to have the students do it as part of the workshop.

.Topic Introduction:
* What is Computer Engineering?
** Electrical Engineering and Computer Science for the development of computer
   hardware and software.
* Is all Engineering using a computer considered Computer Engineering?
* What other types of Engineering can a computer be used for?
** Pretty much everything.

* Make a large table on the whiteboard with the following three headings:
** Communication, Simulation, Automation
** Solicit examples for putting under each heading.
** Communication: Reports, Graphics, Figures, Emails, Collaboration,
                  Software Distribution, Technical Drawings (CAD)
** Design/Simulation: Computer Aided Design (CAD),
                      Finite Element Analysis (FEA),
                      Physical, Chemical, Electrical, Optical, Meteorlogical,
                      Aerospace, Cosmological
** Automation: Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), Numerical Processing,
               Scripting

.Challenges:
1. Communication
* Use Tux Paint (under Graphics) to make an "Engineering Communication"
** Examples: structural drawings, engineering concepts
** More advanced students may explore Gimp, Inkscape and/or LibreCAD

2. Design/Simulation
* Explore physics simulation with Numpty physics (under Games)
* Explore simulation programs in Scratch (under Programming)
** File -> Open -> Examples

3. Automation
* Write a Scratch program to count to 100 by 5's
* Write a Scratch program to count almost to 100 but not past by 6's
* Slow down the count so it's readable
* Draw a square with Scratch
* Draw a triangle, circle, spiral
