=== Ballistic Pumpkins
.Disciplines:
- Mechanical Engineering

.Setup:
Can either have teams build multiple trebs or build one trebuchet (let
the whole class assemble it as 1 team) and then let them break out and
compete on getting the best distance with their own customized sling designs.

Miniature pumpkin gourds or alternatively golf balls may be used for
launching. You could get orange golf balls and or decorate them like
jack-o-lanterns to keep with the pumpkin theme.
