==== Materials
- 50 plastic straws per team
- 1 roll of tape per team
- 25 pennies
- 5 paper cups per team
- Plastic Wrap
- Additional coins/washers
- Large tub or large watertight storage bin
- Stopwatch
- Digital scale (or triple balance scale)
- Internet Media Access

==== Location
Inside or outside on a warm day.

==== Preparation
Fill the tub with water.

=== Demonstration

=== Teaming
Teams of 2-3 making sure youngest are teamed with older student(s)

=== Challenge
Build a boat that can hold 25 pennies for at least 10 seconds before sinking

Give each team tape and straws and let them have at it. Have teams log their
designs and results in their engineering notebooks. For those interested, try
adding additional weight (coins and/or washers) to see how much their boats can
take before sinking.

Students can weigh the coins/washers their boat held and log it in their
notebook. If the scale is sensitive enough they might also weigh their boat.
