.Class Discussion
Shapes of Strength

* Reference: https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/cub_intro_lesson01_activity1[Hands-on Activity: Shapes of Strength]
** What makes buildings strong? Historical examples? (Pyramids, Parthenon)


.Class Activities:
Compression and Tension

CAUTION: These activities have plenty of opportunity for the students to get up
to mischief. Encourage safety and keep a watchful eye.

* Reference: https://nj.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.lp_shapes/shapes-that-make-structures-strong/[Shapes That Make Structures Strong]
** Have student pairs put their hands together palm to palm with arms extended.
  Have them bend their arms at the elbow to experience compression.
  What happens as they walk their feet further away from each other? Don't go
  too far before their feet slip out.
** Now have the students stand side by side and each grab one hand. Have
   them lean away from each other to experience tension. Can they lean farther
   when their feet are braced against each other vs. when they aren't?
   Is it compression or tension forces against their feet?

* Reference: https://nj.pbslearningmedia.org/asset/phy03_doc_lpahumarch/[Building Big: Human Arch Mini-Activity]
** Circle 5 kids around a ball and have them lean in on the ball with one
   arm extended. Have them slide their feet out as far as possible.
** Now push down on the ball to "add weight". The kids feet will start to slip
   out. How can the dome support more compression?
** Add kids (buttresses) seated around the feet of the kids supporting
   the ball (ribs).

.Activity:
Which shape is more stable?

* Reference: https://nj.pbslearningmedia.org/asset/phy03_doc_lpastrawsh/[Building Big: Straw Shapes handout]
** Inquire which shape will be more stable: triangles or squares.
** Supply each group with straws and paper clips. If you have bendy straws,
   cut off the bendy end of eachs straw.
** Pairs of paper clips can be linked and a clip each inserted into a straw
   end will link two straws. In this way build a square and triangular patterns.
   It may help to illustrate the patterns on a white board.
** Compare the different shape stability. By pressing down on the structures.
   What are the failure modes? Brainstorm... (Buckling, Compression, Shear, Split)
** Paperclips pushing in are under compression. Paperclips pulling out are
   under tension.
** How can the square be made more stable? (Connect a straw across the
   diagonal to make a rhombus out of two trinagles).
** Build a structure out of many straws and paperclips (possibly enforcing
   a limit of 40 paperclips and 20 straws). Compete on maximum weight held.
*** Structure should hold weight (books, washers, etc) at least 2" above the
    table surface.
*** Multiple rounds. After first round have everyone compare there results and
    learn what ideas worked and then move on to the next round.
