* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering

.Materials:
* 1 laptop per 1-2 students
* Ubermix Linux operating system
** http://www.ubermix.org/

.Location:
Large room with outlets available at each table

.Preparation:
Install `ubermix` on all of the laptops. Alternatively acquire enough

Device:

* Server, Desktop, Laptop, Phone, Tablet

For each device, run through which O/S, Kernel, CPUs are typically used.

Introduce Scratch on demonstration Laptop:

* Control -> when flag clicked
* Variables -> Make a variable
** set variable, change variable
* Control -> Repeat

.Teaming:
Teams of 1-2

.Challenge:
* Each student create a work of art in Tux Paint (under Graphics)
* See how many levels you can pass in Numpty physics (under Games)
* Scratch challenges (under Programming)
** Write a Scratch program to count to 100 by 5's
** Write a Scratch program to count almost to 100 but not past by 6's
** Slow down the count so it's readable
** Draw a square with Scratch
