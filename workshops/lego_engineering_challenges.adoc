=== LEGO Engineering Challenges
.Disciplines:
* Mechanical Engineering

.Setup:
By selecting one building challenge activity for all of the teams to work
on there is more opportunity for collaboration. If a team completes their
project try to direct them on to additional challenges on the same
project. They may also help out other teams or work on sorting the main LEGO
collection.

.Resources:
The Educating Young Engineers website provides very good ideas for LEGO
design challenges:

.Challenge:
LEGO creations game show

Pick a build time limit like 5 minutes.

Start with an easy level object card for each team. Each team should keep
their card secret from the other teams. Also it may be helpful to pick
objects with a given theme and make everyone aware of what that theme is.

Start the timer and have each team build their creation. The teams may use
their LEGO minifigures as they see fit. You may pick build objects for the
teams that would benefit identification via the use of minifigures.

At the end of the round, each team holds up their creations in turn while
the others secretly write down what they think it is. Every team that
gets a right answer gets a point. Every team that gets their creation judged
correctly gets a point for every correct guess.

For the next round teams may keep their creation and use it as part of their
next build or take parts off of it as they need. You may want to distribute
object cards specifically to encourage creative re-use or previous builds.
Also you can tailor the object build difficulty as a handicap to help keep
the scores fairly close.

.Further Challenges:
* Decrease the allowed build time
* Only show the picture to the team and then take the card back instead
  of letting them keep it to look at the whole time
* Just tell the team what the object is without showing them the picture
* Provide multiple build objects per round
* Run a round where everyone works individually.
* Give everyone the same object and have each team rank every other teams
  build in order. Highest points to best rank.
