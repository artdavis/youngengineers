=== LEGO Building Game Show
.Disciplines:
* Mechanical Engineering

.Setup:
You may come up with various ways to break the students into teams.
For a class size of 16, print the team_cards document:

image::workshops/lego_gameshow/team_cards_1.png["Team Cards",width=400]

Cut out the cards and distribute one to each student. These will allow you to
make 4 teams of 4 unique team members for up to 5 rounds. For example, starting
with number, break the teams out into numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Next round break the
teams out by letter A, B, C, D. Unique teams with no students ever on the same
team again can be made when the teams are broken out by: number, letter, color,
shape and direction. If you have time for more rounds there's also season,
element and phase but the teams won't be unique any more.

Divvy up the LEGO's so there's evenly distributed LEGO quantities at each
team table.

** This is a great video to show the celebration of failure. Point out
   how many weeks of hard work it was building the ball and then what was
   everyone's reaction when it crumbled. Absolute joy!
** Also see what else the class notices from the experiment. Another
   thing to call attention to was the safety precautions. Yes the experiment
   failed, but by making sure everyone is safe, nobody was in danger of
   getting hurt.

.Materials:
* Assorted LEGO's (â‰¥100 pcs assorted per student plus multiple figurines)
* LEGO Creationary cards or similar

.Location:
Classroom/Lab

.Teaming:
Teams of 2-4

.Helpers
Activities helper students may do:
* Run time
* Keep score
* Sort/distribute/cleanup LEGOs
* Judge

.Preparation
Show the MythBusters LEGO ball video and have a discussion about celebrating
failute and practicing safety. What other comments do the students have on
the experiment?

Explain that we're going to have a game show style challenge because a little
competition makes it fun. But remember there's more to be learned by not
winning. If another team gets more points, try not to get frustrated.  Observe
carefull what they did. Learn from your observations. Improve your own methods.
Keep trying.

When something doesn't work shout "Hooray! Science!". Everybody together
shout "Hooray! Science!". Maybe one more time louder. Then jump into the game.

.Challenge:
Play the LEGO Building Game Show

Pick a build time limit like 5 minutes.

Start with an easy level object card for each team. Each team should keep
their card secret from the other teams. Also it may be helpful to pick
objects with a given theme and make everyone aware of what that theme is.

Start the timer and have each team build their creation. The teams may use
their LEGO minifigures as they see fit. You may pick build objects for the
teams that would benefit identification via the use of minifigures.

At the end of the round, each team holds up their creations in turn while
the others secretly write down what they think it is. Every team that
gets a right answer gets a point. Every team that gets their creation judged
correctly gets a point for every correct guess. The points can be tallied
seperately and it will be interesting at the end to analyze which teams
did the best guessing and which teams got the most correctly guessed builds.

For the next round teams may keep their creation and use it as part of their
next build or take parts off of it as they need. You may want to distribute
object cards specifically to encourage creative re-use or previous builds.
Also you can tailor the object build difficulty as a handicap to help keep
the scores fairly close.

Shuffle up the teams using the team cards after each round.

Keep track of the results entering the data in the lego_build_data_record
spreadsheet each round. Save the data and run the Jupyter notebook
data analysis program on the data.


.Further Challenges:
* Decrease the allowed build time
* Only show the picture to the team and then take the card back instead
  of letting them keep it to look at the whole time
* Just tell the team what the object is without showing them the picture
* Provide multiple build objects per round
* Run a round where everyone works individually.
* Give everyone the same object and have each team rank every other teams
  build in order. Highest points to best rank.
