Single Player warmup
Fixed cards per player. Play cards to solution

Multiplayer
Recommended cards may be doled out per board, or players may just have
full access to available function cards. Limit function blocks they have
access to as you see fit. For example, "go to" coordinate blocks should be
restricted.
Each round a player may do one of the following actions:
* Add a card anywhere to the stack
* Remove as many cards from the stack as wanted
* Run the stack
* Optionally you may or may not want to allow a debug step in which any single
  command already in the stack may be executed.
If a player wants their token to go back to their starting home position then
their program should call the "home" block at the beginning. Otherwise they'll
keep on going from their current position and direction.

Balloons cannot be moved and will stop your progress unless
they are popped with lasers
If they are shot with a laser they are removed from the board

Head to head multiplayer
* Play a command to your stack
* Remove card(s) from the stack
* Run your stack
* Add a balloon to the board
* If tokens collide turn 180deg (or go back to home)

Speed coding. Players are allowed to play cards as fast as they want.
* Command cards are executed as they are played. There's no "stack"; command
  cards that have been put down can be replayed any time.
* Leave repeat blocks off to the side. An empty repeat does nothing, but as
   soon as a command is placed within that command is executed the repeat
   number of times. The repeat runs to completion but the command card can be
   left in the block to be built upon.
** The repeat will not run again until another card is played into (or removed
   from it). At which point all the commands in the repeat execute repeat
   times and then halt.
* Define function blocks off to the side. Anything placed in them does nothing
   until a function calling card is played.


Gates cannot be moved or opened
