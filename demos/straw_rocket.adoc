=== Straw Rocket
This demonstration can just as well be repurposed as a full class
activity.

.Materials:
* Whiteboard
* Straw
* 5/8" Foam Backer Rod
* Business cards or thick index cards
* 3D Printed parts from: www.thingiverse.com/thing:1782060
* Optional: squishy bottle

.Location:
Large room or auditorium where all students have a good view.

.Preparation:
* 3D Print the `Forming-Rod` in a rigid material such as PLA
* The `Straw-Holder` and `bottle-tube-coupler` are optional.
  Print these parts if you want to connect the straw to a squeeze bottle for launching.
* Print `Fin-Holder` and `nosecone-plug` in your material of choice.
** Test the fit of a card in the slots of the `Fin-Holder`.
   Use a blade to clean out the slots for a good fit if necessary.
* Preferably print `nose-ogive` in a flex material for safety.
* Push the `nose-ogive` part onto the slotted side of the `nosecone-plug`.
  The friction fit should be sufficient or you may use glue if needed.

.Challenge:
"Design, Build and Launch a Rocket"

.Demonstration
* Inquire of the group what are the parts of a rocket.
  Draw the parts on the whiteboard as they give them to you.
  Keep going until you get the key components:
** Body tube
** Fins
** Nosecone
** Engine
* For the body tube, cut a 3" (75mm) length of 5/8" foam backer rod.
* Use the 3D printed "Forming-Rod" to core a hole through the foam.
  Coring half way through from each side works well.
** Alternatively a straw that has been cut with serrations may be used, but the 3D printed rigid tool is much more effective.
* Ask for ideas for how to make the nosecone.
*  Introduce the 3D printed nosecone assembly and attach that to one end of the foam body tube.
** Alternatives to the 3D printed nosecone might include a shaped piece of clay, candy corn or card stock formed into a cone.
* Announce that you plan to make the fins out of some business/index cards.
  Ask how you might cut 3 exactly identical fins.
* Stack three cards together and cut a fin shape of choice about 1" (25mm) in length.
* Ask how to attach the fins to the body tube.
* Slide the fin-holder onto the rocket body and attach the fins.
** If you don't have the 3D fin-holder it should be possible to glue or tape the fins on.
   You may try scoring three a shallow slits in the foam body or folding the root edge of the fins to help attach them.
* Inquire for ideas about what to use for an engine.
* Bring out the straw and say that we'll use the straw as the engine.
  Slide the rocket on to the long end.
* Have the class do a countdown and on "blastoff" put the straw in your ear.
* Everyone should offer the suggestion that you need to blow into the straw.
* Do another countdown and blow into the straw like your saying "Ha" without closing your mouth around it.
* OK, this time for real, countdown an launch the rocket.

.Optional
If you've got a squishy bottle (a bottle that will survive stomping on and return to it's original shape) you can make a more powerful launcher.
You'll just need a proper sized coupling to connect the bottle to the straw.
The default bottle tube coupler included with on the thingiverse page will fit a 16mm diameter bottle opening.

[NOTE]
TODO: create a customizer for this to fit any bottle size.

* Slide the Straw-Holder onto the straw to secure it at a 90Â° angle.
* Connect the bottle and the straw together using the coupler.
* Get a volunteer to stomp on the bottle and launch the rocket after the
  class does the countdown.
