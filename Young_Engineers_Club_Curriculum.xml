<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Traditionally, education in the field of engineering is not made available to
students until they reach the college level. Even though primary school
students may not be prepared to handle the advanced science and mathematics
that are the typical domain of the engineering disciplines it&#8217;s never too early
to apply engineering principles to solving problems.</simpara>
<simpara>The Young Engineers Club is open to all ages attending the Saratoga Independent
School and will expose students to engineering fundamentals on a level they
will find engaging and fun.</simpara>
<simpara>Each club meeting will briefly introduce an engineering discipline and then
pose an open ended engineering challenge in that realm.  Sometimes the whole
club will work together to solve a problem, other times we will break out in to
teams for some friendly competition. This self-directed problem based
approach is an enjoyable way to foster engineering fundamentals such as
innovation and original thought.</simpara>
<simpara>Engineering areas that we&#8217;ll be exploring include: Acoustical, Aerospace,
Architectural, Biomedical, Chemical, Computer Aided Design, Electrical,
Mechanical, Naval, Optical, Robotics, Rocketry, Software and more.  As the
school year progresses, club members will add skills from earlier topics to
their toolkit which they may bring to bear for solving more interdisciplinary
challenges. If students develop an affinity to certain activities then we&#8217;ll
find ways to incorporate those activities into the various subjects that we
cover. We&#8217;ll also include tangential topics based on student interest.</simpara>
<simpara>Club members will be using tools that may typically be labeled "Keep out of
reach of children" (e.g. cordless drill, soldering iron, etc.). We&#8217;ll be sure
to closely supervise as necessary but also promote empowering students to use
tools safely and effectively. On days where we use tools we&#8217;ll always start out
by emphasizing safety procedures and make sure participants are wearing
appropriate safety gear. Additional precautions will be taken based on age.</simpara>
<simpara>Occasionally we may ask students to bring in craft supplies, various
recyclables or broken gadgets from home for use in the club. If you have a
technological household item that you are going to throw away, consider hanging
on to it to send in when called for so that we can explore some reverse
engineering and disassembling skills.</simpara>
<simpara>Club meetings will be weekly occurring after school on Tuesdays. Parents are
welcome to attend meetings to help with organization and safety but remember,
please try to participate only as a passive resource. The process of trying to
solve a problem without boundary is part of the joy of engineering. As
difficult as it may be to watch your child try to do something the "wrong" way,
this more often than not can lead to a very clever solution that you will find
wonderfully surprising.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, we may plan an occasional weekend meet up at local events that are of
interest to the club (for example, FIRST LEGO tournament).</simpara>

to touch these things. When they do start playing/reading don&#8217;t make them stop
when you move on to new activities.</para></formalpara>
<simpara>Have a computer workstation set up and pointing at the webpage:
<ulink url="http://spacefem.com/quizzes/engineer/">http://spacefem.com/quizzes/engineer/</ulink> During the challenge allow students to
individually come up and take the quiz (with assistance if necessary).  Have
them log their results on the first page in their engineering notebook.</simpara>
<formalpara><title>Challenge:</title><para>Pose the question "What is engineering?". Allow the discussion to be
driven by the students. Invite the students to write down or draw something on
the index cards that they think has to do with engineering. Let them make as
many index cards as they want.</para></formalpara>
<simpara>Also create cards (optionally extra large) with your own selection of
engineering disciplines.  My choices include: Acoustical, Aerospace,
Architectural, Automotive, Biomedical, Chemical, Civil, Computer Aided,
Electrical, Manufacturing, Marine, Mechanical, Optical, Robotic, Software</simpara>
<simpara>Place your cards up on the board and have the kids group their cards with
the topical areas they think they fit with. You can connect categories
with marker lines and/or have multiple cards made if they fit into several
categories. Add categories as necessary. Try to use Venn diagrams to group
things together.</simpara>
<simpara>Based on the results ask the students to pick some of their favorite cards
and try to identify a discipline that they like. Have them log the result
in their notebook and compare that to their quiz results. Have them put their
name and date on the page.</simpara>
<simpara>Redistribute the notebooks so everyone has somebody else&#8217;s notebook.
Invite the students to report on whose notebook they got and what kind of
engineer their colleague is. As a "peer review" then they can sign and date
their name at the bottom of the page and return the notebook to the owner.</simpara>

Ask what will happen if an empty balloon is put at the end of the siphon.
  A balloon full of air? Hold the tube above the level of the tub to stop

  what they think will happen when you remove your thumb and show them. Try
  it with different sized air gaps.
