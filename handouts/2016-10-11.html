Please bring the following materials to the next meeting:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
A clear jar or bottle (12 to 24 fluid oz) with watertight top/cap.
  A water bottle or a sauce jar should work well.
  We’ll be making a "spooky lava lamp" so the effect will be best if the label can be removed.
