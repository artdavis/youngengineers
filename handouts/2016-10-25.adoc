NOTE: Next meeting: November 1, 2016

The next challenge is entitled "Ballistic Pumpkins".
The activity will take place (weather permitting) in the SIS play field.
Please bring the following materials to the next meeting:

* Weather appropriate warm clothing for spending an hour outdoors.
* *OPTIONAL* Mini pumpkins (approximately tennis ball size).
  We will be launching these pumpkins in the field using a trebuchet so they will be ruined.
  You don't need to go out and buy mini pumpkins, just bring any you might have that you don't mind turning into compost.
* *OPTIONAL* Tennis ball. We'll have tennis balls on hand, but you can also decorate your own with marker and bring it.
